# InDesign Tool Suite Harmonization Specification

**Scope:** DocStats, HeaderFix, NormalFix, TableFix
**Deferred:** StyleFix adopts after its v1.0.8 canary passes. Nothing here requires a change to StyleFix while that work is in progress, and the contracts below are written so StyleFix can adopt them without redesign.
**Status:** Proposed. Editorial authority is Johann Darby.

## 1. Why harmonize before fixing

Four repositories currently carry four independent copies of the same helper functions: validity checks, guarded property reads, object type resolution, preview truncation, column padding, location resolution, override detection, color conversion, and CSV writing.

Those copies have already diverged in a way that produced a defect. NormalFix v1.5 replaced `applyParagraphStyle(style, true)` with the character-style-preserving pattern because the older call destroyed applied character styles. HeaderFix still uses the older behavior. The same lesson was learned once and applied once.

Every additional per-tool fix without a shared core recreates that condition.

---

## 2. Distribution model

ExtendScript has no package manager, and the audience for a community release is practitioners rather than developers. The model that resolves both constraints:

**Source is modular. Distribution is a single generated file.**

```
localis-indesign-tools/          suite repository
    core/                        shared modules
    ownership/OWNERSHIP.md       ownership map (authoritative)
    codes/CODES.csv              finding code registry (authoritative)
    build/build.py               inliner
tool repositories                one per tool, consuming core
    src/                         tool-specific source
    dist/ToolName.jsx            generated, committed, installable
```

The build inliner concatenates the required core modules with the tool source and writes one file to `dist/`, stamping a header block with tool version, core version, build timestamp, and a hash of each contributing source file.

This resolves three separate problems at once. Practitioners install one file. Installed-artifact parity becomes trivially checkable, because there is one artifact. The multi-module loader parity mechanism StyleFix is currently carrying becomes unnecessary rather than permanent.

A GitHub Action runs the build and fails on any mismatch between the committed `dist/` file and a fresh build.

---

## 3. Core modules

### 3.1 `core/dom`

`valid()`, `safeProperty()`, `safePropertyObject()`, `objectTypeName()`, `collectionElements()`, and the DOM contract registry.

**Contract registry rule:** no DOM property or method name appears as a bare literal at a call site in any tool. Every name is declared in the registry, probed at startup, and resolved through an accessor. A name that was never registered stops the run.

This is the class-level fix for the recurring wrong-name defect. Four instances are on record: `language` for `appliedLanguage`, `endnotes` on the wrong host, `applyCharacterStyle` on Story, and `indexOptions` for `indexGenerationOptions`. Each was found individually. The registry is what finds the fifth before it ships.

The registry uses the five-state taxonomy already accepted for StyleFix: `SUPPORTED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `NO_APPLICABLE_INSTANCE`, `NOT_EXPOSED`, `FAILED`.

### 3.2 `core/text`

- `overrideState(para)` returning both the value and the detection method used.
- `applyCanonicalParagraphStyle(para, style)` implementing the NormalFix v1.5 pattern: apply without clearing character attributes, then clear paragraph-only overrides, with the enum path and the numeric fallback both recorded.
- `characterStyleSignature(text)` and `formattingSignature(text)` for preservation verification.

**Binding rule:** no tool calls `applyParagraphStyle` directly. The preserving pattern is the only paragraph-style application path in the suite. This closes the HeaderFix divergence permanently rather than by patch.

### 3.3 `core/color`

`colorToRGB()`, `swatchName()`, `isRedFamily()`, and tint-aware evaluation. NormalFix and TableFix currently implement red detection separately for `CLI Code Red Body` and `CLI Code Red Table`. The hue logic is one function; the target style name is a parameter.

Two corrections belong here rather than in either tool:

- The swatch-name test must not bypass color analysis. A name containing "red" as a substring currently short-circuits the hue check, so a brown swatch named Redwood is accepted without examination. Name becomes a supporting signal, or an exact match against a configured list.
- `fillTint` must be evaluated. A tinted instance of a red swatch renders pale, matches on swatch identity, and is currently converted to full strength. Tinted instances are reported for review rather than converted silently.

### 3.4 `core/location`

One container-aware location resolver. The current implementations fail to resolve a page whenever text sits inside a table, an anchored frame, or a group, which was confirmed in the StyleFix v1.0.7 canary run: C14, whose own literal reads "table on parent page," resolved as `No page/Pasteboard`, while C08 on the same parent page resolved correctly.

Location never determines risk in any tool. It determines whether a practitioner can act on a finding, which is the safety net for every row the tool declines to fix automatically. One correct implementation serves all four.

### 3.5 `core/mutate`

The mutation transaction. Every change to a document in every tool passes through it.

```
transaction(label, targets, {
    precheck,    // re-verify eligibility immediately before the change
    snapshot,    // capture everything that must survive
    mutate,      // perform the change
    verify,      // compare post-state against snapshot
    rollback     // restore on verification failure
})
```

Two properties, both currently missing across the suite:

**Batch-level undo grouping.** The whole transaction runs inside `app.doScript` with `UndoModes.ENTIRE_SCRIPT` and the supplied label, so a batch is one undo step rather than dozens.

**Per-item rollback.** A verification failure restores that item rather than leaving the document partly changed. NormalFix currently assigns the red character style, then applies the paragraph style, then verifies, and on failure returns "Could not verify" while leaving the character-style assignment in place. The document has been modified and the report does not say so.

TableFix already implements half of this pattern with its cell-fill snapshot and restore. Generalizing that instinct into the shared contract is most of the work.

### 3.6 `core/report`

The findings model, the code registry loader, and the CSV writer.

CSV output rules for every tool: UTF-8 with BOM, Windows line endings, all fields quoted, control characters escaped to printable form before writing. The v1.0.7 StyleFix CSV contains a raw `\u0004` from a footnote marker, which reads as file corruption to a strict consumer.

**Provenance header.** Every CSV from every tool opens with the same `#`-prefixed block:

| Field | Note |
|---|---|
| Tool name, tool version | |
| Core version, build hash | from the generated header |
| Run timestamp | |
| Document name, path, file modified | |
| InDesign version and build | report `NOT_EXPOSED` rather than an empty field |
| Operating system | |
| Ownership scope | what this tool claims, from the ownership map |
| Mutation state | `AUDIT_ONLY` or `MUTATED`, with the undo label when mutated |
| Counts by finding code | |

A report that cannot be traced to the code that produced it cannot be entered into an errata record six weeks later.

### 3.7 `core/ui`

Palette scaffold, multi-column listbox with sortable headers, the standard button row, Save CSV, and Save Diagnostic.

Two fixes land here for all four tools simultaneously. Space-padded columns do not align in the proportional ScriptUI default font, so a real multi-column listbox replaces `fixed()` padding. And the open-document guard must run inside the scan and every action handler, not once at load. With `#targetengine` the palette outlives the document, so closing it and clicking Rescan currently throws in NormalFix and did in StyleFix.

### 3.8 `core/boot`

Version constants, artifact parity check, measurement-unit normalization to points with restore, and redraw suppression with restore.

---

## 4. Finding codes and severity

Two shared registries, both living in the suite repository and read by the tools rather than restated in each README.

**Code prefixes.** `DS-`, `HF-`, `NF-`, `TF-`, `SF-`. HeaderFix currently uses `H1-`, which reads as a reference to Heading 1 rather than to the tool. Renaming breaks continuity with existing CSVs, so it is a judgment call, but the suite reads more clearly if every prefix names its tool.

**Severity is one axis for all tools:** `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `PASS`.

**Classification is a separate, tool-specific column.** StyleFix's LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and REPLACE are a risk classification, not a severity, and collapsing them into the severity axis would make the two incomparable across tools. TableFix's REVIEW is similarly a classification rather than a severity.

`codes/CODES.csv` carries one row per code across the whole suite: code, tool, severity, meaning, remediable yes or no, and the ownership region it applies to.

---

## 5. Ownership map as an artifact

The ownership boundary currently lives as prose in four separate READMEs, and the prose does not cover the whole document.

One gap is already visible. NormalFix excludes every paragraph inside a table and defers to TableFix. TableFix refuses to remediate complex tables, which are those with merged or spanned cells or multiple header rows, marking them `TF-003` and never changing them. A `Normal+` paragraph inside a complex table is therefore excluded by NormalFix and declined by TableFix. It is owned by nobody, and nothing in either tool reports that condition.

`ownership/OWNERSHIP.md` becomes the single authority: a table of every document region, the tool that owns it, and what that tool does with it. Regions with no owner are listed explicitly as `UNOWNED` rather than being absent. Each tool README links to it instead of restating it, so the map cannot drift out of agreement with itself.

---

## 6. Repository metadata standard

Applies to all five repositories.

| Item | Standard |
|---|---|
| `LICENSE` | Present. None of the repositories currently has one, which leaves a tool that modifies a user's document legally ambiguous to use. |
| No-warranty statement | In the README, in plain language, not only in the license text. |
| `README.md` | Fixed section order: what it does, safety posture, install, usage, finding codes, ownership boundary link, compatibility, license. |
| Safety posture | Stated near the top in fixed vocabulary: `READ-ONLY`, `MODIFIES ON EXPLICIT SELECTION`, or `MODIFIES DOCUMENT-WIDE ON COMMAND`. A practitioner needs to know in five seconds whether the script will touch their file. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Present, one entry per tagged release. |
| Tags | Every release tagged `vX.Y.Z`. No repository currently has a tag, so there is no fixed point to install from. |
| `.gitattributes` | Present in all repositories. Currently only HeaderFix has one. |
| GitHub Action | Build, `dist/` freshness check, version parity check. |
| Repository topics | `indesign`, `extendscript`, `publishing`, `epub`, `typesetting`. Discoverability is the whole point of a community release. |
| Repository description | One descriptive sentence in a consistent register. |

**Note on safety posture.** Writing this down forces an existing inconsistency into the open. NormalFix and TableFix both state that selection is the remediation boundary and that no document-wide Fix All exists. HeaderFix provides Fix All Errors and Clear All Overrides. The exception may be defensible, since the marker population is small and unambiguous, but three tools in one suite should not carry two safety postures by accident.

**DocStats.** The repository contains a one-sentence README, no script, and one open pull request. In the ownership model DocStats is the inventory tool, and the style census StyleFix needs belongs there so that two tools do not count the same population independently. Whatever is in that pull request needs to land before anything can depend on it.

---

## 7. Adoption sequence

Ordered so that the highest-risk condition clears first and no step depends on a later one.

1. **`core/mutate` and its adoption by NormalFix.** Undo grouping and per-item rollback. This is the only item in the specification that addresses a condition capable of damaging the manuscript in its current state.
2. **`core/color`.** The name-bypass and tint corrections. Adopted by NormalFix and TableFix together.
3. **`core/text` and its adoption by HeaderFix.** Removes the last direct `applyParagraphStyle` call in the suite.
4. **Suite repository, ownership map, code registry, build inliner.** Structural work with no behavioral change.
5. **`core/report` and `core/ui`.** Provenance, CSV hardening, listbox, document guards.
6. **Repository metadata across all repositories.** License, tags, changelog, actions, topics.
7. **DocStats.** Land the open pull request, then build the census.
8. **StyleFix adopts core.** After v1.0.8 passes its canary. The multi-module loader parity mechanism retires at this point, replaced by single-file distribution.

Steps 1 through 3 are defect corrections and should not wait on the structural work in step 4. The shared modules can begin life inside one tool and move to the suite repository when it exists.
